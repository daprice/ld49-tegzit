			<h2>Content warning</h2>
			<p>This is a satirical game about the Texas government's handling of the 2021 winter storm, a recent event in which people died.</p>
			<p>I've lived in Texas my whole life and wrote this game as an attempt to find a humorous way to express frustration with the Texas government's callous response to the event, and to poke fun at the conflicts of interest of many of the politicians responsible. In this game, you play as a satirical version of one of those politicians.</p>
			<p>If you aren't comfortable with any of this for any reason, there's no shame in not playing, or stopping if it makes you uncomfortable. Instead, if you live in Texas, I'd ask that you consider registering to vote (if eligible) in next year's state elections.</p>

				This is a goober.
			</p>
			<p>
				Goobers need to be kept between 60° and 80°F.
			</p>
			<p>
				But enough about that. As the Goobernor, the leader of the Goobers, you get most of your campaign funding from the industry that produces and sells Gazz. Gazz, you see, keeps goobers warm, but only if they have electricity to run their gazz furnaces. And it's the Goobernor's job to keep the goobers warm by controlling who gets electricity, and for how long, when it gets too cold outside.
			</p>
			<p>
				Well, that's just the story we tell the goobers. You see, if a goober buys a generator, then they can use gazz to run the generator, which powers their furnace, which burns even more gazz. It's the gazz industry's dream! But goobers only buy generators if they really need them.
			</p>
			<p>
				There's a rival political party, the Purpleist Party, that doesn't think goobers should <em>have</em> to buy generators to stay warm, and is gaining grassroots support. But that's a load of hooey. Don't forget that the gazz industry put you in office as a member of the Orangetive Party!
